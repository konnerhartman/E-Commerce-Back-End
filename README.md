# E Commerce Back End
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)
  
## Description
  This app is the back end for an e-commerce site. I have configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit me as a full-stack web developer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This app was built to gain expience and gain valuable knowledge of back end development practices including ORM, Express.JS, MySQL, SQL, Sequilize, API's, Node.JS, and NPM's.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This app will allow business to manage and control an e-commerce site by pairing it with this back-end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While building this app I learned about object-relational Mapping (ORM), while also continuing my practice with other back end tech like Express.JS and SQL.

## Installation
  To install this app, start by cloning this rep. Then, while in the terminal, install the NPM's by running `npm install`. After that, insure the database is being used. Sign into mysql and run `SOURCE db/schema.sql;`, then `exit`. Then, seed the database by running `node seeds/index.js`. Finally, you're ready to `npm start` and start using this app in an API tester (I use Insomnia!).
  
## Usage
  This app would be used to help any e-commerce run a website for their business.
